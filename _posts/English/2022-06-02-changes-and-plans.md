My blog has essentially been a deserted landscape since my last post in 2018 when the world was in a more typical state, devoid of extreme conflicts or pandemics. I recently devoted a few hours to updating the layout, giving it a slightly geeky vibe. I've noticed that I've become less inclined to share, a habit that used to be beneficial. So, I'm making some adjustments.

The exact nature of these changes isn't entirely clear at the moment. Will there be more writing and sharing? Probably.

A notion that's been on my mind and lingering since some time is to write a book, or perhaps create a series of articles, focused on YouTube’s Recommendation system, an area that currently consumes the majority of my professional life. Inevitably, there will be policy and confidentiality considerations. I'm pondering if there's a way to navigate these hurdles—perhaps by only discussing public information readily available on YouTube’s engineering blog or certain tech publications. Yet, I'm also intrigued by the idea of diving deep into the subject matter, though that might involve consulting our legal team to gauge its feasibility. It's worth noting that individuals at YouTube treat this topic with utmost seriousness.

Assuming that all regulatory barriers are resolved, I see this as an opportunity to consolidate my work, accomplishments, and insights into the core of YouTube—the Recommender system. The endeavor could provide answers to fundamental queries that many people want to learn about: Why and how does YouTube suddenly comprehend a viewer's interests and then suggest numerous related videos after watching just one?
