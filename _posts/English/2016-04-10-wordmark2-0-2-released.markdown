It's been 50 days since I published my first desktop application WordMark. After the first release, I have got a lot of time to update it and make the second version thanks to my not-busy fulltime job. Today I am glad to announce that the new version 2.0.2 has been released in three platforms: Mac, Windows and Linux.

A lot of people were saying that the old icon was like Dayone's very much, so the first thing I did in WordMark 2 is to change the logo slightly.

Some other cool features are as follows:

- Improved UI performance
- Add Windows and Ubuntu version
- Add file management system
- Add code highlight function
- Add drag-and-drop image uploading
- Add many more publishing platforms including Evernote, Ghost, Github, etc

I really learned a lot from the development of 2.0.2 and there are still a lot of features I would like to add to WordMark to make it as close as to perfect.
