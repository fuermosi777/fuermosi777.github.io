[Q][1] is a quantitative technical analysis platform I created. It has three main components:

- Q command: powered by Django 1.8 and Python 3, it has different modules which are responsible for tasks such as stocks information updating, prices information fetching, database inserting and so on.
- Strategy center: it is the core component that use strategy to do backtesting and simulation.
- Q.js: the front-end library that convert data from API to visualized charts and other stuff.

The database contains all stock information of Chinaâ€™s Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges of all time.
