[Stockbucks][1] is a web app that allows users to search for stocks in NYSE and NASDAQ based on the ticker symbol. The app displays the historial prices of a stock in a line chart in different time slots (weeks, months and years). The user can also export selected data as a .CSV file for later use (e.g. MS Excel).

This project is a group project for my last course at NYU, the Programming in Python, Spring 2015. The project is based on Django framework 1.8 and Python 3.

I acted as the full-stack developer, developing the front-end, the backend and the system of the project.
