## Introduction

Leastimator is a simple app that helps you the track the mileage of your leased car.

The app provides an elegant line chart to help you avoid going over mileage limit by adjusting your driving. It also shows a predicted mileage you will reach through an unique algorithm model.

To begin with, just enter lease duration, lease start date, mileage allowed, etc to create your first car profile.

Note: the predicted mileage is calculated based on your periodic odometer readings and might not be the actual mileage when your lease ends.

The app is built with React Native.
