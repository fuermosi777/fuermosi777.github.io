[bpaccountants.com][1] is the official website for Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP. Bernstein & Pinkchuk LLP is a New York based independent public accounting firm providing professional audit and assurance, tax and transaction services. I was responsible for building the official website in both Mandarin and English for the firm using Wordpress and PHP.

[cn.marcumbp.com][2] is the other official site for the merged company Macrum Bernstein & Pinchuk in Mandarin. Due to complicated requirements, the website is developed using Python/Django, and hosted in Amazon Web Services. I built the CMS system for the company. I cooperated with a project manager and a designer in the project. I was responsible for communicating with the designer and the manager about the front-end design, and coding the front-end and the backend.
