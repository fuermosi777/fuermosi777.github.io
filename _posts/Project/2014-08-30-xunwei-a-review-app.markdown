## Introduction 
Xunwei app is the iOS app for [Xun-wei.com][1], which aims to solve the problem that tourists, international students and other relevant people from China can hardly get useful information from website such as Yelp or FourSquare, partly because of the different food culture and partly because of language differences. This app can help its users to explore, collect and share restaurants based on their geo-locations. Following figure shows some basic element I used in the app.

The app can be downloaded from the [App Store][2].
