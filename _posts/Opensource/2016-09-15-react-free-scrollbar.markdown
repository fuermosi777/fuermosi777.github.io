## Introduction

[React-free-scrollbar](http://liuhao.im/react-free-scrollbar/) is a react module for creating customizable scroll area.

I built this initially for some of my side projects, which are running on a lot of different browsers that handle scrollbars differently. For example, programmers cannot change how scrollbar looks like in Firefox. In macOS, however, the scrollbar behaves differently when the user is using a mouse or a touchpad. To solve this, React-free-scrollbar is a perfect component for React developers to create their own scrollbars.

The component supports both vertical and horizontal scrollbars.

The project is open-sourced under MIT license and the documentation can be found at [Github](https://github.com/fuermosi777/react-free-scrollbar).
