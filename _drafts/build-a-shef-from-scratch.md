1. The Backstory

When we moved into the house we are currently living two years ago, there was a large vacant land on the side of the house. The shape is abnormal -- it's a triangle. That area was used as a swiming pool until the previous owner decided to sell the house and paid a ton of money to fill the pool, leaving a completely bare soil with nothing growing on. After a rainy winter in the San francisco bay area, however, it turns into a mini jungle -- vegatarians grows everywhere, mostly Cluster mallow, a editable Chinese weed. We decided to do something to stop it from growing into a real jungle.

The idea was to remove and control the plants, to build a shed which can hold all my power tools, and to build a small garden around it. I don't want to build a typical farmhouse style shed; instead, I prefer the aesthetic appealing of the modern lean-to shed as I don't want to build a shed-shed, but a shed that can be converted into a small office or a gym, which adds the value to the house when we sell it in a few years.

After watching a few YouTube videos of "How to build a shed", I decided to apply my own instance. There was no hard budget limit, but there was a [decent shed](https://www.costco.com/northport-wood-storage-shed---do-it-yourself-assembly.product.4000051398.html) on sale in Costco which had a price tag of around $2,500 and I don't want to spend more than that, excluding my hour rate.

After a few hours researching across Pinterest and playing with Sketchup, I drew some rough designs of the shed:

It was a 8x8 shed, with 2 feet in addition to the facade to add a small porch and some accent. It was inspired by [Autonomous work pod](https://www.autonomous.ai/pod-adus). Unlike the regular lean-to shed, there is no overhang to the building. It adds risks of water instrusion and the complexity of structual implementation, in exchange of a minimal look, but I think it worth the trade-off.

After returning from a 3 week vacation in China, I started the building. If you have a 2-year old little one like I do, you know how impossible this job looks like -- during weekdays I need to work, during weekends I need to spent all my time on him. There is just so little time I have to spend on the building job. Fortunately, there was no a single drop of rain water during the entire summer and fall, which seems to be a dream world in the construction world.

2. Foundation

It is hard to believe that there are more than [13 options](https://www.siteprep.com/shed-foundation-options/) for a shed foundation. The most popular choice would be to build a concrete slab. Prepare the ground, pull out a rectangle shape of lumbers on it and pour the concrete, then it's done. Despite its straightforward, I don't like this idea. First of all, it's not a one-man job. As a starter, I deeply doubt if I am capable of mixing 50 plus bags of concrete. Surely I can order mixed concrete on trucks, but it adds so much complexity and uncertainties such as late delivery. Remember I have a energetic 2-year old? As a parent, I need flexibility. I can also hire some concrete guys to do the work for me. But that means over-budget. Also I recently watched a video from YouTube explaining how concrete industry is one of the biggest contributor to the global warming. Last but not least, concrete slab making the 8x8 small shed a permenent structure, which I dislike very much -- who likes permenent stuff?

I also skipped some other popular options such as gravel pad (too difficult), skid (looks unreliable), etc. As a final decision, I choose to use deck blocks, mostly because I already have 8 of them, and they are cheap and sturdy (around $9 each block).

I used 12 blocks hoping to make the weight spread as evenly as possible. Afterall it's only 8x8, using more than 12 blocks sounds overkill to me. I didn't do any math to support myself, but the Autonomous pod only uses 6 blocks and it's larger than my design. I think it will be fine. The lumbers are pressure treated 2x6x8, and I added tapes on the top side to add its longevity.

Digging 12 holes and make them level is one of the most chanllenging tasks for this job. The ground is not even, so each hole is different in depth. Not to mention that this is a 2-dimentional measurement, making it more difficult to level. Plus that this summer is one of the warmest in history, I can only work in the morning. But, eventually, it's all done.

The block decks were put in the holes and surroundings were filled with leftover white gravels -- technically they are decoration garden stones so it was a bit waste. Also I had to move some maple I planted a year ago and replan some gardening irritation pipes. The entire foundation job took me near a month to complete.
