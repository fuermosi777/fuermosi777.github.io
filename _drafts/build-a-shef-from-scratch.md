1. Start

When we moved into our current house two years ago, we discovered a peculiar piece of land adjacent to it. It wasn't just any land; it was a triangle. The previous owner had used it as a swimming pool, but when they decided to sell the house, they emptied their pockets to fill up the pool. What we were left with was a barren patch of soil with nothing growing on it. However, after a rainy San Francisco Bay Area winter, it decided to transform itself into a mini jungle, with vegetarians sprouting everywhere. Well, mostly Cluster Mallow, which happens to be an edible Chinese weed. It seemed like this plot was on a mission to become a real jungle.

So, we decided it was high time to rein in this wild territory. The plan was threefold: tackle the rampant plant growth, construct a shed to house my arsenal of power tools, and create a small garden around it. Now, I didn't want just any run-of-the-mill farmhouse-style shed. No, my vision was a modern lean-to shed, something that could do more than just shelter tools. I wanted a shed with potential – one that could double as a small office or even a gym, adding extra value to the house for that eventual sale in a few years.

After binge-watching a slew of "How to Build a Shed" videos on YouTube, I decided to embark on my own DIY adventure. Budget-wise, I didn't have a fixed limit, but I stumbled upon this [decent shed deal at Costco](https://www.costco.com/northport-wood-storage-shed---do-it-yourself-assembly.product.4000051398.html) for around $2,500. Seemed like a fair deal to me, especially when excluding my hourly 'shed-construction maestro' rate.

Following a few hours of scouring Pinterest and dabbling with Sketchup, I came up with some rudimentary shed designs:

This design drew inspiration from the 'Autonomous Work Pod.' But here's the twist – it's not your typical lean-to shed; it doesn't have an overhang. Sure, it adds a bit of excitement with the risks of water intrusions and structural complexities, but it's all in the name of that sleek, minimalistic look. I believe it's a trade-off worth making.

So, after returning from a three-week vacation in China, I rolled up my sleeves and got down to business. Now, if you've got a two-year-old whirlwind at home like I do, you understand just how colossal this job seems. On weekdays, I'm juggling work, and on weekends, I'm a full-time entertainer. There's barely any time left for shed-building shenanigans! Thankfully, not a single drop of rain dared to disrupt our grand shed adventure throughout the entire summer and fall. In the world of construction, that's like living in a fairy tale, without the dragons."
